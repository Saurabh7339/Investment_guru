[32mINFO[0m:     2025-07-15 20:38:14 the recommnedations are Here are 3-5 specific investment recommendations tailored to Robert Johnson:

```
[
  {
    "asset_class": "Fixed Income",
    "specific_investment": "Treasury Bonds",
    "allocation_percentage": 40,
    "rationale": "Given Robert's low risk tolerance and capital preservation goal, Treasury Bonds provide a stable source of income with minimal market volatility. This allocation also helps to diversify his portfolio.",
    "expected_risk_level": "Low",
    "time_horizon": "5-10 years"
  },
  {
    "asset_class": "Equities",
    "specific_investment": "VYM - Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF",
    "allocation_percentage": 20,
    "rationale": "As a retired investor, Robert is likely seeking steady income streams. VYM's dividend yield of 3.1% and low risk profile make it an attractive addition to his portfolio.",
    "expected_risk_level": "Low",
    "time_horizon": "5-10 years"
  },
  {
    "asset_class": "Equities",
    "specific_investment": None,
    "allocation_percentage": 20,
    "rationale": "Robert's preferred investment types include Dividend ETFs, so I'm recommending a small allocation to this asset class. However, given his low risk tolerance and medium-term time horizon, we'll focus on lower-risk options like VYM.",
    "expected_risk_level": "Low",
    "time_horizon": "5-10 years"
  }
]
```

And as an additional consideration:

* Since Robert has a preference for CDs (Certificates of Deposit), I would recommend allocating up to 20% of his portfolio to short-term CD laddering strategy. This approach involves investing in multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates, providing liquidity and reducing interest rate risk.
* Consider adding NOBL or SPYD to the mix if Robert's risk tolerance increases over time or if he wants to explore other dividend-focused investment options. These ETFs have shown consistent performance and could provide additional income streams.

These recommendations are designed to preserve capital, generate steady income, and align with Robert's risk tolerance and investment goals.
